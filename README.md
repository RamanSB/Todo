This project represents a full-stack ToDo App that I have created using the MERN stack. MongoDB has been used as the database that stores the TodoModel collections defined using the mongoose library.
Server side code such as defining routes, controller functionality & configuring the server app (i.e. listening at ports, ensuring server app supports CORS) has been acheived using the express library.
React has been used for the front-end development. The MaterialUI library has also been used.
